Intro:

Evict Right represents a basic website that was created using HTML and CSS. Although I am still learning how to code, I did not use bootstrap. I was attempting to code everything from scratch. 

The website is meant to be simple because the eviction process is already overwhelming as it is. Most eviction companies have too much information on their website that it can be quite intimidating. 

User Stories:

As a real estate agent, I want to be able to evict a tenant if necessary in order to maintain the quality of our homes that are being rented out. 

As a home owner, I want to know my rights and responsibilities as a landlord to provide better quality living for my tenants. 

As a tenant/renter, I want to know the reasons why I could get evicted so that I can prevent myself from that situation.

Future Improvements:

1. I would like to add a login portal for customers who have existing evictions. Where they can just login and search their case. It will have the most recent update on your eviction case. It will prevent unnecessary phone calls that might slow the person who is creating the eviction down.

2. I would like to add multiple language options for those who primarily do not speak English.

3. I would like to add maps and locations when the business expands.
